Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which was released in 2011. The first movie introduced the origin story of Caesar, a chimpanzee who was genetically modified by a scientist and gained human-like intelligence. The movie also showed how a virus that was created as a cure for Alzheimer's disease accidentally spread across the world and killed most of the human population.
 
The second movie picks up 10 years later, where Caesar has established a colony of intelligent apes in the Muir Woods near San Francisco. The apes have not seen any humans for years and believe they are extinct. However, they soon encounter a group of human survivors who are looking for a hydroelectric dam that could restore power to their city. The humans are led by Malcolm, a former architect who wants to make peace with the apes, and Dreyfus, a former military officer who wants to wipe them out.
 
The movie follows the tense interactions between the two groups, as well as the internal conflicts within them. Caesar has to deal with his loyal friend Maurice, a wise orangutan who advises him to trust the humans, and his rebellious lieutenant Koba, a scarred bonobo who hates the humans for torturing him in a lab. Malcolm has to deal with his son Alexander, who befriends an ape named Blue Eyes, and his girlfriend Ellie, who is a nurse who helps treat Caesar's wife Cornelia. The movie also shows how some of the apes can use guns and ride horses, and how some of the humans can speak sign language.
